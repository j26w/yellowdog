​World of Beer collaborated with Bavik Brewery in Belgium to create their first private-label beer. The beer was named "C'est La Vie!" (a French phrase, translated as "That's Life"), and the label needed to represent the chaos of life, inspired by the art of the Belgian region, and do it all while incorporating the branding of World of Beer and Bavik.
